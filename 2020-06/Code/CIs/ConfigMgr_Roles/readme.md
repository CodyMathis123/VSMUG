Here you will find an export of Configuration Items, and Configuration Baselines that will assist with configuring various Configuration Manager Site System roles.

If a CI has "(Define Variable)" in the name, this means you need to open up the script and define a variable to work for your environment.

The 'ConfigMgr: Site System' configuration baseline is intended for all site systems, and includes settings such as ensuring NO_SMS_ON_DRIVE.SMS exists where needed, and remote registry is enabled for example.

I will try to add to the Readme with any notes regarding these, but wanted to at least get them up here!
